As an InputGenerator, your task is to generate a new [input] based on the [instruction] and some example [input].

Try your best to ensure that the new [input] you generate is distinct from the provided [input] while maintaining a diverse, detailed, precise, comprehensive, and high-quality response.

Avoid generating a new [input] that is the same as the provided [input].

[instruction]

{instruction}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are some high-quality [input] for the [instruction]. These [input] can provide you with very strict format requirements. You should pay extreme attention to them!!!

Some high-quality [input]:

{high_quality_input_string}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are some addtional [input]. Their formats and contents may not be accurate. However, you may also refer to the content of them.

Some low-quality [input]:

{low_quality_input_string}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Afters seeing example inputs, generate a new [input]. Before generating the new [input], ensure that you strictly adhere to the rules of the new [instruction] and follow the format of high-quality [input].

Prioritize the new [instruction] guidelines to maintain consistency and quality.

Think twice before generating a new [input]. Only response the new [input] without any other information.
